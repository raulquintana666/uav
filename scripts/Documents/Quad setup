1.
	first upload arduino code (just in case):

	sometimes the accelerometer only works when you upload the example code prior to the actual 		driver code:

	"TEST_ADXL345.ino"

	now the real code can be uploaded

	"quad_v1.ino"

2.	now run a ROS master in terminal

	$ roscore

	now run the quad driver node in a new terminal

	$ rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

3.	If you want to listen to the data being published

	$ rostopic echo gro_x
